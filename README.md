# Algorithm Exploration

### Purpose
This repository contains code that was written in order for me to explore different algorithmic approaches to problem solving. This repository does not contain a single piece of software but rather a wide selection of singular functions and classes that will each do something on their own. Along with functions implementing particular algorithms or solving specific questions, there are also several implementations of different data structures that are used in varying functions.

### Currently Implemented Date Structures
* Linked List

 ### Compiling the Code
The code was originally written using the c++ language in the open source Integrated Development Environment [Qt Creator.](https://www.qt.io/ide/)

**NOTE:** This code by itself can be compiled but because it lacks a main() function it will fail at the linking stage. To build it completely it is necessary to add an empty main() function.
